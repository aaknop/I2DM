In the previous chapters we used the property that the set is finite. However,
we have never defined formally what it means. In this chapter we define
cardinality which is a formalization of the notion size of the set and explain
how to compare sizes of two sets.

\section{Bijections}
The simplest way to explain that one set has the same number of elements as
another is to show a correspondence between elements of these sets. For example,
in order to explain that the set $\set{0, \pi, 1 / 4}$ has the same number of
elements as $\set{1, 2, 3}$ we may just say that $0$ corresponds to $1$,
$\pi$ corresponds to $2$, and $1 / 4$ corresponds to $3$. More formally such a
correspondence is defined using the following definition.
\begin{definition}
    Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function. We say that $f$ is a bijection iff the
    following properties are satisfied.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every element of $Y$ is an image of some element of $X$. In other
            words,
            \[
                \forall y \in Y~\exists x \in X\ f(x) = y.
            \]
        \item Images of any two elements
            of $X$ are different. In other words,
            \[
                \forall x_1, x_2 \in X\ f(x_1) \neq f(x_2).
            \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Let us consider the following example. Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a
function such that $f(x) = x + 1$; Note that it is a bijection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For any $y \in \mathbb{R}$, $f(y - 1) = (y - 1) + 1 = y$.
    \item If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $x_1 + 1 = x_2 + 1$ i.e. $x_1 = x_2$.
\end{itemize}


\begin{exercise}
    Show that $x^3$ is a bijection.
\end{exercise}

One of the nicest properties of bijections is that composition of two bijections
is a bijection.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:bijections-composition}
    Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be some sets and $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be
    bijections. Then $(g \circ f) : X \to Z$ is also a bijection.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We need to check two properties.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $x_1 \neq x_2 \in X$. Note that $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ since $f$
            is a bijection. Hence, $g(f(x_1)) \neq g(f(x_2))$ since $g$ is a bijection
            as well. As a result, $(g \circ f)(x_1) \neq (g \circ f)(x_2)$.
        \item Let $z \in Z$; we need to find $x \in X$ such that
            $(g \circ f)(x) = z$. Note that since $g$ is a bijection there is
            $y \in Y$ such that $g(y) = z$. Additionally, there is $x \in X$ such
            that $f(x) = y$ since $f$ is a bijection. Thus,
            $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = z$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Probably the most important property of a bijection is that we may invert it.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:inverse-of-bijections}
    Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function. $f$ is invertible (i.e. there is a function
    $g : Y \to X$ such that $(f \circ g)(y) = y$ and $(g \circ f)(x) = x$ for all
    $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$) iff $f$ is a bijection.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{description}
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] Let's assume that $f$ is invertible. We need to prove
            that $f$ is a bijection.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Let's assume that $f$ does not satisfy the first property in the
                    definitions of bijections i.e. there are
                    $x_1, x_2 \in X$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ but
                    $x_1 = g(f(x_1)) = g(f(x_2)) = x_2$, which is a
                    contradiction.
                \item Let $y \in Y$. Note that $f(g(y)) = y$, hence,
                    $\Im f = Y$.
            \end{itemize}

        \item[$\Leftarrow$] Let's assume that $f$ is bijective. We need to define a
            function $g : Y \to X$ which is an inverse of $f$. Let $y \in Y$, note
            that there is a unique $x$ such that $f(x) = y$, we define $g(y) = x$.
            Note that $f(g(y)) = y$ for every $y$ by the construction of $g$.
            Additionally, $g(f(x)) = x$ since $f(g(f(x))) = f(x)$ and $f$ is a
            bijection.
    \end{description}
\end{proof}
\noindent We denote $g$ from this theorem as $f^{-1}$ and in case when $f$ is
not a bijection $f^{-1}(y)$ denotes the set $\set[f(x) = y]{x \in X}$.
\nomenclature[F]{$f^{-1}$}{denotes the inverse of the function $f$ (it's
defined only when $f$ is a bijection)}
\nomenclature[F]{$f^{-1}(y)$}{depend on the context if $f$ is not a bijection
it denotes the set $\set[f(x) = y]{x \in X}$ and it denotes the value of
$f^{-1}$ at $y$ if $f$ is a bijection}

Using Theorem~\ref{theorem:inverse-of-bijections} we may notice that
nonetheless that $X \times (Y \times Z)$ is not the same as
$(X \times Y) \times Z$, there is a natural correspondence between the elements
of these sets.
\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be some sets.
    There are bijections from $X \times (Y \times Z)$ and
    $(X \times Y) \times Z$ to $\set[x \in X, y \in Y, z \in Z]{(x, y, z)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Since the statement is symmetric, it is enough to prove that there is
    a bijection $f : X \times (Y \times Z) \to
    \set[x \in X, y \in Y, z \in Z]{(x, y, z)}$. Define $f$ such that
    $f(x, (y, z)) = (x, y, z)$.
    Clearly, $f^{-1}(x, y, z) = (x, (y, z))$ is the inverse of $f$, so $f$ is
    indeed a bijection.
\end{proof}
Due to this correspondence we will think about elements $(x, (y, z))$,
$((x, y), z)$, and $(x, y, z)$ as they are equal to each other.

Because of the following therem, bijections are very useful in combinatorics.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:bijection-to-equality}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be two finite sets such that there is a bijection $f$ from
    $X$ to $Y$. Then $|X| = |Y|$.
\end{theorem}

Using this result we can make prove the following equality.
\begin{corollary}
\label{corollary:power-set-and-set-of-binary-strings}
    Let $X$ be a finite set of cardinality $n$. Then $2^X$ has the same
    cardinality as $\set{0, 1}^{|X|}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    To prove this statement we need to construct a bijection from $2^X$ to
    $\set{0, 1}^{|X|}$. Let $|X| = n$ and $f : X \to \range{n}$ be a bijection.

    First we construct a bijection $g_1 : 2^X \to 2^{\range{n}}$:
    \[
        g_1(Y) = \set[x \in Y]{f(x)}.
    \]
    It is easy to see that the function
    \[
        g^{-1}_1(Y) = \set[{x \in \range{n}}]{f^{-1}(x)}
    \]
    is an inverse of $g_1$, so $g_1$ is indeed a bijection.

    Now we need to construct a bijection $g_2$ from $2^{\range{n}}$ to
    $\set{0, 1}^n$:
    $g_2(Y) = (u_1, \dots, u_n)$, where $u_i = 1$ iff $i \in Y$. It is clear
    that $g^{-1}_2(u_1, \dots, u_n) = \set[u_i = 1]{i \in \range{n}}$ is an
    inverse of $g_2$ so $g_2$ is indeed a bijection.

    As a result, by Theorem~\ref{theorem:bijections-composition}, the function
    $(g_2 \circ g_1) : 2^X \to \set{0, 1}^{|X|}$ is a bijection.
\end{proof}

\section{Surjections and Injections}

It is possible to note that the definition of the bijection consists of two part.
Both of these parts are interesting in their own regard, so they have their own
names.
\begin{definition}
    Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We say that $f$ is a surjection iff every element of $Y$ is an image
            of some element of $X$. In other words,
            \[
                \forall y \in Y~\exists x \in X\ f(x) = y.
            \]
        \item We say that $f$ is an injection iff images of any two elements
            of $X$ are different. In other words,
            \[
                \forall x_1, x_2 \in X\ f(x_1) \neq f(x_2).
            \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    Let $f : X \to Y$ be an injection. Then $g : X \to \Im f$ such that
    $f(x) = g(x)$ is a bijection.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
    Let $\R^+ = \set[x > 0]{x \in \R}$. Is $f : \R^+ \to \R^+$ such that
    $f(x) = x + 1$ a surjection/injection?
\end{exercise}

Like in the case of the bijection we may use surjections and injections to
compare sizes of sets.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:injections-surjections-inequalities}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite sets.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If there is an injection from $X$ to $Y$, then $|X| \le |Y|$.
        \item If there is a surjection from $X$ to $Y$, then $|X| \ge |Y|$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
