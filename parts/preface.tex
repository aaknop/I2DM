    - Because it's full of problems.

If you are reading this book, you probably have never studied proofs before.
So let me give you some advice: mathematical books are very different from
fiction, and even books in other sciences. Quite often you may see that some
steps are missing, and some steps are not really explained and just claimed as
obvious. The main reason behind this is to make the ideas of the proof more
visible and to allow grasping the essence of the proof quickly.

Since the steps are skipped, you cannot just read the book and believe that you
learned the topic; the best way to actually learn the topic is to try to prove
every statement before you read the actual proof in the book. In addition to
this, I recommend trying to solve all the exercises in the book --- you may find
them in the middle and at the end of every chapter --- and especially the
exercises labeled as recommended.

Additionally, many topics in this book have a corresponding short videos
explaining the material of the chapter, it is useful to watch them before you go
into the topic.
