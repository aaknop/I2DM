\chapter{Matrix Games}
In this chapter we are going to use mathematical methods to model interactions
and conflicts between different actors. To simplify the analisis we are going to
consider interactions between \emph{two} actors that are trying to maximize
their payoffs.

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{strategic form}, or \emph{normal form}, of a two-person game is
  a tuple $(X, Y, A, B)$ such that $X$ and $Y$ are some nonempty sets, and 
  $A, B  : X \times Y \to \R$.
\end{definition}
The interpretation is as follows. Simultaneously, the first player chooses 
a strategy $x \in X$ and the second player choses a strategy $y \in Y$ , each
unaware of the choice of the other. Then their choices are made known and the
first player wins $A(x, y)$ and the second player wins $B(x, y)$. (Depending on
the monetary unit involved, $A(x, y)$ and $B(x, y)$ will be dollars, rubles,
euros, etc.) If $A(x, y)$ or $B(x, y)$ is negative, the corresponding player
loses the absolute value of this amount.

It is importnat to note that the notion of a strategy is very broad; e.g., a
strategy for a game of chess, is a complete description of how to play the game,
of what move to make in every possible situation that could occur. We are going
to ignore the fact that in the game of chess it is physically impossible to
describe all possible strategies since there are too many of them (in fact,
there are more strategies than there are atoms in the known universe). On the
other hand, the number of games of tic tac toe is rather small, so that it is
possible to study all strategies and find an optimal strategy for each player.

In cases when $X$ and $Y$ are small sets it is convinient to describy such games
using tables. Let us consider the game described by the following table.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l l  l  l  l  l  l  l}
    \toprule
          & heads  & tales   \\
    \midrule
    heads & 1, -1 & -1, 1   \\
    tales & -1, 1 & 1, -1   \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
In this game two players put one coin each on the table: if the the coins have
the same side up, then the second player pays $1$ dollar to the first player,
otherwise the first player pays $1$ dollar to the second player. In other words,
the firs number denotes the payoff of the first player and the second denotes
the payoff of the second player.

\begin{exercise}
  Describe the game in normal form corresponding to rock paper scissors.
\end{exercise}

An important class of games is zero-sum games.
\begin{definition}
  A game $(X, Y, A, B)$ is \emph{zero-sum} if $A(x, y) = -B(x, y)$ for all 
  $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.
\end{definition}
It is clear that the game we described is a zero-sum game.

\section{Domination and Pareto Optimal Strategies}
In \Cref{part:combinatorial-games} we studies optimal strategies; however, in
case of games in the normal form it is not clear what does it mean optimal. To
illustrate this difficulty, let us discuss the most famous game, the prisoner's
dilemma:
\begin{game}
  Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in
  solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The
  prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal
  charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously,
  the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the
  opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed
  the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible
  outcomes are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in
      prison.
    \item If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve
      three years in prison (and vice versa).
    \item If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in
      prison (on the lesser charge).
  \end{itemize}
\end{game}

It is clear that this game can be described using the following table.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l l l  l  l  l  l  l  l}
    \toprule
               & cooperates  & defects   \\
    \midrule
    cooperates & -1, -1      & -3, 0    \\
    defects    & 0, -3       & -2, -2   \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


Let us try to put ourself into these prisoners shoes. If our parter is silent,
then it is better for us to defect (in this case we are free immidiately); if
our partner defects, then is is also better for us to defect (we'll get two
years instead of three). Therefore, no matter what our partner does it is always
better to defect. Since the game is symmetric both players come to this
conclusion and get two years each; however, if both of them cooperates they
would serve only one year\footnote{%
  In 1993 Frank, Gilovich, and Regan conducted an experimental study of the
  prisoner's dilemma. The subjects were students in their first and final years
  of undergraduate economics, and undergraduates in other disciplines. Subjects
  were paired, placed in a typical game scenario, then asked to choose either to
  ``cooperate'' or to ``defect''. 

  First year economics students, and students doing disciplines other than
  economics, overwhelmingly chose to cooperate. But 4th year students in
  economics tended to not cooperate. Therefore, the authors concluded that
  that the study of economics reduces cooperation in games. The idea is
  that much of the time cooperation and consideration of other's perspective are
  irrational in the narrow sense of the word. Thus, learning that cooperation is
  irrational in some situations is influencing the behavior of the students
  towards less cooperation, presumably to the negative.
}.

Let us generalise the argument we used to justify why defecting is better thatn
cooperating.
\begin{definition}
  Let $(X, Y, A, B)$ be a game in normal form. We say that $x_1 \in X$
  \emph{dominates} $x_2 \in X$ iff $A(x_1, y) \ge A(x_2, y)$ for all $y \in Y$.
  We also say that $x_1$ \emph{strictly dominates} $x_2$ if $A(x_1, y) > A(x_2,
  y)$ for all $y \in Y$.

  Similarly we may define domination of strategies for the second player.
\end{definition}
It seems reasonable to never choose $x_2$ provided that $x_1$ dominates $x_2$; in
the prisoners dilemma ``defects'' dominates ``cooperates''; hence, it seems
choosing ``defects'' is the best behaviour for rational agents.

However, it also obvious that if both players cooperate is way better than if
both of them defects; this observation leads to the following observation.
\begin{exercise}
  Let $(X, Y, A, B)$  be a game in the normal form. We say that $(x, y) \in X
  \times Y$ is Pareto optimal pair of strategies if either $A(x', y') < A(x, y)$
  or $B(x', y') < B(x, y)$ for any $(x', y') \in X \times Y$.
\end{exercise}
In other words, a pair of strategies is Pareto optimal if any other choice would
decrease the payoff for at least one of the players.
