\chapter{Yao's Principle}
Using game theory we may develop a method for proving lower bounds on complexity
of randomized algorithms. To illustrate this method we will study the problem we
duscussed in \Cref{chapter:expectation,chapter:structural-induciton}: Alice
choose a number from $\range{1000}$, Bob can flip a coin and ask yes/no
questions; Bob would like to guess it using, on average, as few questions as
possible. We claim that Bob needs at least $9$ questions.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:randomized-dts-lower-bound}
  Let $\Omega$ be a set of $B$-decision trees and $\Distribution{D}$ be a
  probability distribution on $\Omega$. If $\DTValue{T}{x} = x$ for all 
  $x \in \range{1000}$ and $T \in \Omega$, then
  $\expectation[\Distribution{D}]{\DTValue{T}{x}} \ge 9$ for some $x \in
  \range{1000}$.
\end{theorem}

To prove this statement we would need to give formal notions of randmoized
$B$-decision tree complexity and heuristic $B$-decision tree cmplexity.
\begin{definition}
  Let $f : [1000] \to \Z$ be a function. We say that $\bar{T} = 
  (\Omega, \Distribution{T})$ is a \emph{randomized}\footnote{%
    In fact, there are many notions of randomized computation; the algorithms
    discussed in this chapter are usually called zero-error randomized
    algorithms.
  }
  \emph{$B$-decision tree for $f$ of cost $C$}
  if $\Omega$ is a set of $B$-decision trees, $\Distribution{T}$ is a
  probability distribution on $\Omega$, $\DTValue{T}{x} = f(x)$ for all $x \in
  \range{1000}$, and 
  $\expectation[T \gets \Distribution{T}]{\DTHeight[x]{T}} = C$.

  We also say that $T$ is a \emph{heuristic $B$-decision tree for $f$ of
  expected cost $C$ with respect to a distribution $\Distribution{X}$} if 
  $\DTValue{T}{x} = f(x)$ for all $x \in \range{1000}$ and
  $\expectation[x \gets \Distribution{X}]{\DTHeight[x]{T}} = C$.

  The \emph{randmoized $B$-decision tree complexity $\RandCBDT{f}$ of $f$}
  is equal to the minimal $C$ such that there is a randomized $B$-decision tree
  for $f$ of cost $C$.

  The \emph{heuristic $B$-decision tree complexity
  $\HeurCBDT[\Distribution{X}]{f}$ of $f$ with respect to $\Distribution{X}$} is
  equal to the minimal $C$ such that there is a $B$-decision tree for $f$ of
  expected cost $C$ with respect to $\Distribution{X}$. Finally, \emph{the
  heuristic $B$-decision tree complexity $\HeurCBDT{f}$ of $f$} is equal to the
  maximum of $\HeurCBDT[\Distribution{X}]{f}$ over all distributions
  $\Distribution{X}$.
\end{definition}

Nonetheless that we have not had the notion of randomized complexity before, we
proved upper bounds in \Cref{chapter:expectation}. Unfortunately, proving lower
bounds directly for randomized complexity is not easy, but it is usually way
easier to prove lower bounds on heuristic complexity. Yao's principle (also
called Yao's minimax principle or Yao's lemma) gives a connection between these
measures.
\begin{theorem}[Yao's principle]
  Let $f : [1000] \to \Z$ be a function. Then $\RandCBDT{f} = 
  \HeurCBDT{f}$.
\end{theorem}


Using this principle is easy to prove the lower bound.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{theorem:randomized-dts-lower-bound}]
  Note that the theorem says that $\RandCBDT{\identity{\range{1000}}} \ge 9$;
  hence, it is enough to prove that $\HeurCBDT{\identity{\range{1000}}} \ge 9$.
  Let us assume the opposite; i.e., that for any distribution $\Distribution{X}$
  there is a $B$-decision tree $T$ such that $\DTValue{T}{x} = x$ for all $x \in
  \range{1000}$ and $\expectation[x \gets \Distribution{X}]{\DTHeight[x]{T}} <
  9$.

  This implies that there is a $B$-decision tree $T$ such that 
  $\sum_{x \in \range{1000}} \DTHeight[x]{T} < 9000$; we are going to prove that
  this is impossible. Let us fix such a $T$.

  We prove, using induction by $|S|$ that $\sum_{x \in S} \DTHeight[x]{T} \ge
  |S| \log_2 |S|$. The base case for $|S| = 1$ is clear since 
  $\DTHeight[x]{T} \ge 1$ for all $x \in \range{1000}$. 
  
  Let us prove the induction step. Let $T = \DTIf{f}{T_0}{T_1}$, and let 
  $S_0 = \set[f(x) = 0]{x \in S}$ and $S_1 = \set[f(x) = 1]{x \in S}$.
  It is clear that $\sum_{x \in S} \DTHeight[x]{T} = |S| + 
  \sum_{x \in S_0} \DTHeight[x]{T} + \sum_{x \in S_1} \DTHeight[x]{T}$. By the
  induction hypothesis, this implies that $\sum_{x \in S} \DTHeight[x]{T} = |S|
  + |S_0| \log_2 |S_0| + |S_1| \log_2 |S_1| \ge |S| + |S| \log_2 (|S| / 2) =
  |S| \log_2 |S|$.

  Therefore, $\frac{1}{1000} \sum_{x \in \range{1000}} \DTHeight[x]{T} \ge
  \log_2 1000 > 9$, which contradicts the assumption.
\end{proof}
