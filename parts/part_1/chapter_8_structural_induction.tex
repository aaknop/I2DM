\chapter{Structural Induction}
To illustrate the notions we introduce in this chapter let us consider the
following game: Alice have chosen a number from $1$ to $1000$. Bob wants to
guess the number so he is asking Alice ``yes'' or ``no'' questions.
How many questions does Bob need to ask to determine the number in the
worst-case scenario?

The following simple algorithm allows Bob to learn the number using $10$
questions.\footnote{%
  This algorithm is based on the same ideas as \Cref{algorithm:binary-search}.
}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Bob start with two numbers $\ell = 0$ and $u = 1000$.
  \item \label{algorithm-step:binary-search-decision-guess-number}
    Bob asks whether the Alice's number is at most $(\ell + u) / 2$.
    If the answer is yes, then Bob replace $u$ by $(\ell + u) / 2$;
    otherwise Bob replace $\ell$ by $(\ell + u) / 2$.
  \item \label{algorithm-step:binary-search-result-guess-number}
    If there is only one integer $x$ between $\ell$ and $u$, Bob
    says that Alice's number is $x$. Otherwise Bob goes to
    step~\ref{algorithm-step:binary-search-decision-guess-number}
\end{enumerate}

Now we have two problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item we need to prove that the algorithm is correct and
  \item we would like to prove that it is impossible to guess the number
    using less questions.
\end{itemize}

To study both these problems we need a formal definition of an algorithm that
Bob may use. However, the first problem is somewhat less demading and
the solution can be explained without a precise definition.

First note that the Alice's number is always between $\ell$ and $u$. Hence,
the answer given at step~\ref{algorithm-step:binary-search-result-guess-number}
is always correct. You may also notice that on each step $u - \ell$
decreases by $2$; hence, after $\ceil{\log_2 1000} = 10$ questions $u - \ell < 1$.
As a result, after $10$ questions, there is only one integer between $\ell$ and
$u$.

\begin{exercise}
  Give a nonadaptive algorithm for Bob that allows him to guess the number
  using $10$ queries. In other words, write $10$ questions such that
  answers to these questions allow Bob to guess the number.
\end{exercise}

\section{Recursive Definitions}
First note that any question for Alice can be formulated as follows:
``Is the value of a function $f$ at your number equal to $\ltrue$?'', where
$f$ is a function from $\Z$ to $\set{0, 1}$ (here and in the sequel
we interpret $1$ as ``yes'' and $0$ as ``no'').

Hence, there are two possible behaviours of any algorithm for Bob.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The algorithm prescribes Bob to just say that the answer is some
    number $x \in \Z$, or
  \item The algorithm prescribes Bob to ask whether $f$ at Alice's number is
    equal to $\ltrue$. If the answer is yes, then the algorithm prescribes Bob
    to proceed according to an algorithm $A_1$, otherwise the algorithm
    prescribe Bob to proceed according to an algorithm $A_0$.
\end{itemize}

Hence, any algorithm for Bob can be described using the following object.
\begin{definition}
  We say that $T$ is a $B$-decision tree if
  \begin{description}
    \item [(base case)] either $T$ is equal to an integer, or
    \item [(recursion step)] $T$ is equal to $(f, T_0, T_1)$,
      where $f : \Z \to \set{0, 1}$, and $T_0$ and $T_1$
      are $B$-decision trees.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}
Note that this definition is not quite formal since it is recursive and
we usually do not allow recursive definitions. So we will need to give a more
formal way to define $B$-decision trees. However, this definition allows us to
prove that $(f_1, (f_2, 1, 2), (f_3, 3, 4))$
is a $B$-decision tree, where
\begin{gather*}
  f_1(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } x \le 2 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}, \\
  f_2(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}, \\
  \text{and} \\
  f_3(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } x = 3 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}.
\end{gather*}
This can be explained as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is clear that $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ are $B$-decision trees by the
    base case.
  \item Hence, by the recurstion step case, $(f_2, 1, 2)$ and $(f_3, 3, 4)$
    are $B$-decision trees.
  \item Finally, by the recurstion step case, $(f_1, (f_2, 1, 2), (f_3, 3, 4))$
    is a $B$-decision tree.
\end{itemize}
In other words we proved that $(f_1, (f_2, 1, 2), (f_3, 3, 4))$
is a $B$-decision tree by providing $T_1$, \dots, $T_7$ such that
$T_7 = (f_1, (f_2, 1, 2), (f_3, 3, 4))$ and for each $i \in [7]$,
$T_i$ is a number from $\Z$ or $T_i = (f, T_j, T_k)$ for $j, k < i$ and
$f : \Z \to \set{0, 1}$.

This idea leads to the framework that would allows us to give a formal
definition of $B$-decision trees.
\begin{definition}
  Let $U$ be a set, let $S_0 \subseteq U$, and let
  \[
    \mathcal{F} =
    \set{F_1 : U^{\ell_1} \to U, \dots, F_n : U^{\ell_n} \to U, \dots}.
  \]
  The we say that the set $S$ generate by $\mathcal{F}$ from $S_0$ is
  the set of all $u \in U$ such that there is a sequence
  $u_1$, \dots, $u_m$ satisfying the following constraints: $u_m = u$ and
  for each $i \in \range{m}$,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item either $u_i \in S_0$, or
    \item $u_i = F(u_{k_1}, \dots, u_{k_\ell})$
      for $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and $k_1, \dots, k_\ell < i$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
In case of $B$-decision trees $U$ is the set of all sequences of numbers,
parentheses, commas, and functions from $\Z$ to $\set{0, 1}$,
$S_0$ is the set of all sequences consisting of one number, and
\[
  \mathcal{F} =
  \set[
    {
      f \text{ is a function from } \Z
        \text{ to } \set{0, 1}
    }
  ]{F_f},
\]
where $F_f(T_0, T_1) = (f, T_0, T_1)$.

\begin{remark}
  Let $U$ be a set, let $S_0 \subseteq U$, and let
  \[
    \mathcal{F} =
    \set{F_1 : U^{\ell_1} \to U, \dots, F_n : U^{\ell_n} \to U, \dots}.
  \]
  Let us consider the sets $S_0, \dots, S_n, \dots \subseteq U$ such that 
  \[
    S_{i + 1} = S_i \cup 
    \set[u_1, \dots, u_\ell \in S_i, F \in \mathcal{F}]{F(u_1, \dots, u_\ell)}.
  \]
  It is clear that $\bigcup_{i \ge 0} S_i$ is the set generated by $\mathcal{F}$
  from $S_0$.
\end{remark}

Using similar ideas we may define some functions on the objects defined
recursively.
\begin{definition}
  Let $T$ be a $B$-decision tree. Then the height $h(T)$ of $T$ can be
  defined as follows.
  \begin{description}
    \item [(base case)] If $T$ is equal to a number $x \in \Z$, then $h(T) = 0$.
    \item[(recursion step)] If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are $B$-decision trees, then
      $h\big((f, T_1, T_2)\big) = \max(h(T_1), h(T_2)) + 1$.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}
Note that $h(T)$ correpsonds to the worst-case number of queries made by Bob if
we interpret $T$ as a description of an algorithm.

However, before we explain how to formalize such a definition, we need to note
that in the general case such definition may be contradictory. Consider
$U = \R$, $S_0 = \set{0}$, and $\mathcal{F} = \set{f, g}$, where $f(x, y) = xy$
and $g(x) = x + 1$. We define $v : U \to \R$ as follows.
\begin{description}
  \item [(base case)] $v(0) = 0$.
  \item[(recursion step)] $v(f(x, y)) = f(v(x), v(y))$ and
    $v(g(x)) = v(x) + 1$.
\end{description}
Note that $v(f(g(0), g(0))) = f(v(g(0)), v(g(0))) = \big(v(g(0))\big)^2 = 4$
and $v(g(0)) = v(0) + 2 = 2$.
However, $g(0) = 1$ and $f(g(0), g(0)) = 1$.

Therefore handle such an issue, we consider $S$ that is \emph{freely} generated
from $S_0$ by by $\mathcal{F}$.
\begin{definition}
  The set $S$ is freely generated from $S_0$ by by $\mathcal{F}$ iff it is
  generated by $\mathcal{F}$ from $B$,
  $S_0 \cap \Im F = \emptyset$, and $\Im F \cap \Im G = \emptyset$ for any
  $F, G \in \mathcal{F}$.
\end{definition}

The following theorem claims existence of functions defined recursively.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:recursion-principle}
  Let $S \subseteq U$ be the set freely generated from $S_0 \subseteq U$ by
  $\mathcal{F} =
    \set{F_1 : U^{\ell_1} \to U, \dots, F_n : U^{\ell_n} \to U, \dots}$.
  In addition, let $G_0 : S_0 \to V$ and
  $G_1 : V^{\ell_1} \to V, \dots, G_n : V^{\ell_n} \to V$, \dots
  be some functions.

  Then there is a function $h : S \to V$ such that
  \begin{description}
        \item [(base case)] $h(u) = G_0(u)$ for any $u \in S_0$.
        \item[(recursion step)] $h(F_i(u_1, \dots, u_{\ell_i})) =
            G_i(h(u_1), \dots, h(u_{\ell_i}))$ for any $i$ and
            $u_1, \dots, u_{\ell_i} \in S$.
  \end{description}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove \Cref{theorem:recursion-principle}.
\end{exercise}

$B$-decision tree are used in this chapter to represent Bob's algorithms;
hence, we need to define values of $B$-decision trees.
\begin{definition}
  The value
  $\mathrm{val}(T, n)$ of a $B$-decision tree $T$ at an integer $n$ can
  be defined as follows.
  \begin{description}
      \item [(base case)] If $T$ is just an number $x \in \range{1000}$,
        then the number the result $\mathrm{val}(T, n)$ is equal to $x$.
      \item[(recursion step)] If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two representations of
        Bob's algorithms, then
        \[
          \mathrm{val}\Big((f, T_0, T_1), n\Big) =
          \begin{cases}
            \mathrm{val}(T_0, n) & \text{if } f(x) = 0 \\
            \mathrm{val}(T_1, n) & \text{otherwise}
          \end{cases}.
        \]
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

Using all these notions we can reformulate the results about Alice and Bob's
game.
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:guess-the-number}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a $B$-decision tree $T$ such that
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $h(T) \le 10$ and
        \item $\mathrm{val}(T, n) = n$ for any $n \in \range{1000}$.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Let $T$ be a $B$-decision tree such that $\mathrm{val}(T, n) = n$ for
      any $n \in \range{1000}$. Then $h(T) \ge 10$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove the first part of \Cref{theorem:guess-the-number}.
\end{exercise}

\section{Structural Induction Theorem}
To prove the second part of \Cref{theorem:guess-the-number} we need
to introduce the notion of structural induction.

\begin{theorem}[The Structural Induction Principle]
\label{theorem:structural-induction}
    Let $S \subseteq U$ be the set freely generated from $S_0 \subseteq U$ by
    $\mathcal{F} =
      \set{F_1 : U^{\ell_1} \to U, \dots, F_n : U^{\ell_n} \to U, \dots }$.

    Assume that $S' \subseteq U$ is a set such that the following constraints
    are true.
    \begin{description}
        \item [(base case)] $S_0 \subseteq S'$
        \item[(induction step)]
          $F_i(u_1, \dots, u_{\ell_i}) \in S'$ for any
          $u_1, \dots, u_{\ell_i} \in S'$ and $i \in \N$.
    \end{description}
    Then $S \subseteq S'$.
\end{theorem}

Using this result, we may prove \Cref{theorem:guess-the-number}.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{theorem:guess-the-number}]
  We need to prove only the second part of the statement.
  Let $V(T) = \set[n \in \Z]{\mathrm{val}(T, n)}$, where $T$ is a $B$-decision
  tree. This proof is based on the following observation.
  \begin{claim}
  \label{claim:guess-the-number}
    For any $B$-decision tree $T$, size of $V(T)$ is at most $2^{h(T)}$.
  \end{claim}

  Assume that $T$ is a $B$-decision tree such that $\mathrm{val}(T, n) = n$ for
  any $n \in \range{1000}$. Whence $\range{1000} \subseteq V(T)$. Therefore 
  $V(T)$ has at least $1000$ elements. As a result, $2^{h(T)} \ge 1000$;
  which implies that $h(T) \ge 10$.

  So we just need to prove \Cref{claim:guess-the-number}. We prove it using
  structural induction. Let $S'$ be the set of decision trees $T$ such that size
  of $V(T)$ is at most $2^{h(T)}$.
  \begin{description}
    \item[(base case)] If $T$ is equal to an integer $x$, then 
      $\mathrm{val}(T, n) = x$ for any $n \in \Z$. Hence, the size of $V(T)$ is
      equal to $1 = 2^0 = 2^{h(T)}$.
    \item[(induction step)] Assume that $T = (f, T_0, T_1)$ for some 
      $T_0, T_1 \in S'$. We know that the size of $V(T_0)$ is at most
      $2^{h(T_0)}$ and the size of $V(T_0)$ is at most $2^{h(T_1)}$. In 
      addtion, it is clear that $V(T) \subseteq V(T_0) \cup V(T_1)$. Therefore,
      the size of $V(T)$ is at most\footnote{%
        Formally speaking, we use \Cref{theorem:additive-principle} to prove
        this; i.e. we use the fact that the size of a set $A \cup B$ is at most
        the size of $A$ plus the size of $B$.
      }
      \[
        2^{h(T_0)} + 2^{h(T_1)} \le 2^{\max(h(T_0), h(T_1)) + 1} = 2^{h(T)}.
      \]
  \end{description}
  Hence, by \Cref{theorem:structural-induction}, $S'$ is equal to the set of all
  $B$-decision trees.
\end{proof}

Now we are ready to prove \Cref{theorem:structural-induction}.
\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{theorem:structural-induction}]
    We prove the statement using induction. More precisely, we prove using
    induction by $m$ that if there is a sequence
    $u_1$, \dots, $u_m$ such that
    for each $i \in \range{m}$, $u_i \in S_0$ or $u_i = F(u_{k_1}, \dots, u_{k_\ell})$
    for $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and $k_1, \dots, k_\ell < i$, then $u_m \in S'$.

    The case when $m = 1$ is clear since in this case $u_1 \in S_0$ which implies
    that it is in $S'$.

    Let us now prove the induction step. Assume that the statement is true for any
    $k \le m$. Consider a sequence $u_1$, \dots, $u_{m + 1}$ such that
    for each $i \in [m + 1]$,
    $u_i \in S_0$ or $u_i = F(u_{k_1}, \dots, u_{k_\ell})$
    for $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and $k_1, \dots, k_\ell < i$. Let us consider
    $F \in \mathcal{F}$ and $k_1, \dots, k_\ell < m + 1$ such that
    $u_{m + 1} = f(u_{k_1}, \dots, u_{k_\ell})$. By the induction hypothesis,
    $u_{k_1}, \dots, u_{k_\ell} \in S'$. Therefore, by the properties of $S'$,
    $u_{m + 1} \in S'$.
\end{proof}

  \exercise[recommended]
    Using recursive definition we can define an arithmetic formula on the
    variables $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$,
    \begin{description}
      \item [(base case)] $x_i$ is an arithmetic formula on the variables $x_1$,
        \dots, $x_n$ for all $i$; if $c$ is a real number, then $c$ is also an
        arithmetic formula on the variables $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$.
      \item[(recursion step)] If $P$ and $Q$ are arithmetic formulas on the
        variables $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$, then $(P + Q)$ and $P \cdot Q$ are
        arithmetic formulas on the variables $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$.
    \end{description}

    We can also define recursively the value of such a formula.
    Let $v_1$, \dots, $v_n$ be some integers.
    \begin{description}
      \item[(base cases)] $x_i\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} = v_i$;
        in other words, the value of the arithmetic formula $x_i$ is equal to
        $v_i$ when $x_1 = v_1$, \dots, $x_n = v_n$; if $c$ is a real number,
        then $c\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} = c$.
      \item[(recursion steps)] If $P$ and $Q$ are arithmetic formulas on the
        variables $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$, then
        \begin{gather*}
          (P + Q)\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} =
          P\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} +
          Q\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} \\        
        \text{and} \\        
         (P \cdot Q)\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} =
         P\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n} \cdot
         Q\big\rvert_{x_1 = v_1, \dots, x_n = v_n}.

    We say that $L$ is a $B$-decision list 
    \begin{description}
      \item[(base case)] if either $L$ is a number $y \in \Z$, or
      \item[(recursion step)] $L$ is equal to $(f, v, L')$ where $f : \Z \to
        \set{0, 1}$, $v \in \Z$, and $L$ is a $B$-decision list.
    \end{description}

    We can also define the value $\mathrm{val}(L, x)$ of a $B$-decision list $L$ at
    $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    \begin{description}
      \item[(base case)] If $L$ is a number $y$, then $\mathrm{val}(L, x) = y$, and
      \item[(recursion step)] if $L = (f, v, L')$, then
        \[
          \mathrm{val}(L, x) = 
          \begin{cases}
            v & \text{if } f(x) = 1 \\
            \mathrm{val}(L', x) & \text{otherwise}
          \end{cases}.
        \]
    \end{description}

    Similarly one may define the length $\ell(L)$ of a $B$-decition list $L$.
    \begin{description}
      \item[(base case)] If $L$ is a number $y$, then $\ell(L) = 1$, and
      \item[(recursion step)] if $L = (f, v, L')$, then $\ell(L) = \ell(L') + 1$.
    \end{description}

    Assume that $\mathrm{val}(L, x) = x$ for any $x \in [1000]$ show that 
    $\ell(L) \ge 1000$.

    Let us consider the following game modification of the game studied in this
    chapter. Alice have chosen a number from $1$ to $1000$. Bob wants to
    guess the number so he is asking Alice ``yes'' or ``no'' questions.
    However, he cannot get more than $\ell$ ``yes'' answers; i.e., as soon as Alice
    says $\ell$th ``yes'', Bob is supposed to be able to guess her number.
    \begin{enumerate} 
      \item Show that if $\ell = 1$, then Bob needs at least $1000$ quesitons.
      \item Show that if $\ell = 2$, then Bob needs at least $\sqrt{1000}$
        quesions.
      \item Show that if Bob needs at least $\sqrt[\ell]{1000}$ questions.
      \item Show that if $\ell = 2$, there is an algorithm for Bob such that he
        is able to guess the number using $2\ceil{\sqrt{1000}}$ questions.

  \exercise You have a $100$-story building and two eggs. When you drop an egg
    from any floor of the building, the egg will either break or survive the
    fall. If the egg survives, then it would have survived any lesser fall. If
    the egg breaks, then any greater fall would have broken it as well. The eggs
    are all identical and interchangeable. You’d like to find the minimum height
