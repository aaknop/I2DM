In this part we use our knowledge about basics of mathematical reasoning
to study games similar to checkers, chess, shogi, and tic tac toe. The games we
are going to study are called combinatorial games. In these games there are two
players, each know all the information, there are no chance moves, and when the
game ends there is always a winner.
(The last condition implies that among the beforementioned games only checkers
are combinatorial since all of them allow draws; however, we may change the
rules to disallow the draws and this change would make all of them
combinatorial.) Such a game is determined by a set of positions, and possible
moves from each position for each player. Usually, players are taking turns
until they reach a position such that no moves are possible and one of the
player is declared a winner.

\section{Take-Away Game}

Since chess, shogi and even tic tac toe are relatively complicated,
we are going to start from much simpler example of combinatorial games.
\begin{game}[Take-Away Game]
\label{game:take-away-21-3-2-1}
  In this game there are two players.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item They have a pile of $21$ chips.
    \item They make moves in turns with player I starting,
      each move consists of moving one, two or three chips out of the pile.
    \item The player that removes the last chip wins.
  \end{itemize}
\end{game}
The question we would like to answer is there a strategy for one of the players
to always win? So in the rest of this part we assume that both players are
playing optimally; i.e., if there is a winning strategy they follow the strategy.

To analyze this game we need the following two observations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the game is symmetric and the only difference between the players is
    who makes the first move, and
  \item if at some point the players have $n$ chips it does not matter how they
    achieved this, it will not affect the rest of the game.
\end{enumerate}
Using this remarks and induction (this style of induction is sometimes
referred as \emph{backward induction}) we are able to analyze the game.

Let us consider some certain states of the game.
Assume that they have at most $3$ chips left, in this case the player that make
the move wins. However, if there are $4$ chips, the
player that makes the first move should always take at least $1$ chip so it
loses since after its turn there are at most $3$ chip. Similarly, if there
are $5$ chips, the first player to move wins since she can take a chip and
make the second player to start with $4$.

So we can formulate the following conjecture.
Assume that $n$ chips left in the pile. Let $r$ be the reminder of $n$ modulo
$4$. Then if $r = 0$, the first player to move loses, otherwise, the other
player loses.

Let us prove this using induction. We already proved the base case so
we need to prove the induction step from $n$ to $n + 1$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If $n \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$, then the first player to move can remove one
    chip and the other player will start with $n$ chips so by the induction
    hypothesis he/she loses.
  \item If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. then the first player to move can remove two
    chips and the other player will start with $n$ chips so by the induction
    hypothesis he/she loses.
  \item If $n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. then the first player to move can remove three
    chips and the other player will start with $n$ chips so by the induction
    hypothesis he/she loses.
  \item If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. then after the current player move the other
    player will start with either $n$, or $n - 1$, or $n - 2$ chips. But all
    these numbers have non-zero reminders modulo $4$. So the other player
    can win in any case.
\end{itemize}

To study combinatorial games we need to give a formal definition of them.
\begin{definition}
  A game is combinatorial if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there are two players,
    \item there is a set of possible positions in the game,
    \item for each position and each player, there is a fixed set of possible
      legal moves,
    \item players alternate moving,
    \item the game ends when no moves are possible for the player whose
      turn is to move.
  \end{itemize}
  There are possible winning conditions,
  \begin{description}
    \item [normal play rule:] the player that made the last move wins, and
    \item [mis\`ere play rule:] the player that made the last move loses.
  \end{description}
  If the game never ends, we declare a draw. If the game always ends, we
  say that the game satisfies \emph{the ending condition}.

  If the possible moves are the same for both players the game is
  called \emph{impartial} otherwise it is called \emph{partisan}.
\end{definition}

Note that these games do not allow random moves, hidden information,
simultaneous moves, and a draw in a finite number of steps so
poker, battleships, rock-paper-scissors, and tick tack toe are not
combinatorial games.

Since we gave a formal definition of combinatorial games we can give a framework
that allows to analyze these games.
\marginurl{%
    P-positions and N-positions:\\\noindent
    Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory \#2
}{youtu.be/YV_oWBi1_ck}
\begin{definition}
  We say that a position in a combinatorial game is \emph{terminal} if there
  are no legal moves.

  All terminal positions are \emph{P-positions}. Every position that allows for
  the current player to move to a P-position is an \emph{N-position}. If all
  possible moves lead to N-positions, then the position is a P-position.

  For the game using the Mis\`ere rule, the definition is the same except the
  terminal positions are N-positions.
\end{definition}

Using this definition, one may create the following procedure that would allow
to determine which positions are P-positions and which are N-positions.
\begin{template}
  \textbf{Steps necessary to find P- and N-positions} \\

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Label all terminal positions as P-positions.
    \item If some position is not labeled but all the moves lead to labeled
      positions, then label the position using the definition; i.e., if there
      are moves leading to P-position, it is an N-position, otherwise it is a
      P-position.
    \item If not all the positions are labeled, go to Step~2.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{template}


Note that P- and N-positions are defined recursively so in some games not all
the positions are either P- or N-positions. (For example, if there are no
terminal positions.) However, \Cref{theorem:grundy-to-np}
proves that if the game satisfies the ending condition, then all the positions
are either P- or N-positions.


\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l}
      \toprule
      0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
      \midrule
      P & N & N & N & P & N & N & N & P \\
      \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{P-positions and N-positions for \Cref{game:take-away-21-3-2-1}}
  \label{table:take-away-21-3-2-1}
\end{table}


So in \Cref{game:take-away-21-3-2-1} the only terminal position is $0$;
hence, $0$ is a P-position. Similarly we can go to $0$ from $1$, $2$, and
$3$ so they are N-positions. Hence, $3$ is a P-position,
since all the moves from $4$ lead to N-positions.
\begin{exercise}
  Show that a position $n$ is a P-position if $4$ divides $n$, and
  it is an N-position otherwise.
\end{exercise}

In other words, in this game, P-positions coincide with the positions where the
current player loses. However, it is not a coincidence.
\begin{theorem}
  If some position in a combinatorial game is an N-position, then the player to
  move has a winning strategy if we start from this position. If the position
  is a P-position, then the other player has a winning strategy.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Subtractraction Games}
Let us define a big class of games that generalizes the take-away game we
discussed at the beginning of the chapter.
\begin{game}
  Let $S \subseteq \N$ be some set. The subtraction game with the subtraction
  set $S$ is the following combinatorial game.
  Two players start with a pile of $n$ chips.
  On each move they remove $s \in S$ chips out of the pile.
\end{game}

So \Cref{game:take-away-21-3-2-1} is the subtraction game with the subtraction
set $\set{1, 2, 3}$.

Let us analyze the subtraction game with the subtraction set $\set{1, 3, 4}$.
\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l}
      \toprule
      0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
      \midrule
      P & N & P & N & N & N & N & P & N \\
      \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{P-positions and N-positions for \Cref{game:take-away-21-3-2-1}}
  \label{table:subtraction-4-3-1}
\end{table}
Clearly $0$ is a P-position since it is the only terminal position in the game.
We can go to $0$ from $1$ so $1$ is an N-position. The only possible move from
$2$ is to $1$ so $2$ is a P-position. From $3$ and $4$ we can go to $0$
so they are N-positions. From $5$ and $6$ one may go to $2$ so they are a
N-positions as well. Hence, $7$ is a P-position.

Now we may notice the pattern: $n$ is a P-position iff $n \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$
or $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$. We prove is using induction. The base case for $n < 8$
we already proved. Let us now prove the induction step. Assume that the
statement is true for all $k < n$. Consider the following cases.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $n \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to
    $n - 1 \equiv 5 \pmod {7}$, $n - 3 \equiv 4 \pmod {7}$, or
    $n - 3 \equiv 5 \pmod {7}$ which are all N-positions so $n$ is a P-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to $n - 1$ which
    is a P-position so $n$ is an N-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to
    $n - 1 \equiv 1 \pmod {7}$, $n - 3 \equiv 6 \pmod {7}$, or
    $n - 4 \equiv 5 \pmod {7}$ which are all N-positions so $n$ is a P-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to $n - 1$ which
    is a P-position so $n$ is an N-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to $n - 4$ which
    is a P-position so $n$ is an N-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to $n - 3$ which
    is a P-position so $n$ is an N-position.
  \item If $n \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$, the current player can move to $n - 4$ which
    is a P-position so $n$ is an N-position.
\end{enumerate}
